   Navigate to your desired location and create a project folder. Initialize a new Scrapy project with:

6. Create a Spider:
   Open your project in a code editor (I used VSCode) and create a spider for scraping:

8. Inspect and Scrape the Website:
   Use Scrapyâ€™s shell to inspect the webpage:
   
   scrapy shell https://www.bbc.com/news

   Identify the HTML classes or tags from which you want to extract information. For instance, to scrape article headlines:
   
   response.css('h2.sc-4fedabc7-3.zTZri::text').get()

10. Adjust and Execute the Spider:
   Modify your spider to scrape the desired data, such as headlines and summaries. Run your spider to start scraping!
